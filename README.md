Hand Addition 2 player game

all hands start at 1 point each

goal is to make opponent's both hands equal zero.

add any of your hand's points to opponent's either hand, so that opponent's hand equals mod 5, if it becomes zero that hand is knocked out.

all scores are always mod 5 so even when addition of hands goes > 5, it becomes acceptable.


also:
dormant now. wont be worked upon.
just a project to kill time.
